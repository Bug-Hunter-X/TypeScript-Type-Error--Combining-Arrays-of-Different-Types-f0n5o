# TypeScript Type Error: Combining Arrays of Different Types

This example demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript when attempting to combine arrays of different types using generics.  The `combineArrays` function aims to combine two arrays of any type, but the type inference fails when arrays of differing types are used.

## Problem

The issue arises from TypeScript's type system not allowing implicit type coercion between different types within a generic array.  Even though the `combineArrays` function is declared to accept arrays of type `T`, it cannot handle the case where `T` represents both numbers and strings.

## Solution

The solution involves explicitly defining the generic type `T` in a more restrictive way, or using type unions to accommodate both types. Alternatively, you can use an any type to circumvent the type safety, but this is not recommended in general.
